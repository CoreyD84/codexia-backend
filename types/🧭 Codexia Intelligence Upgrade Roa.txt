🧭 Codexia Intelligence Upgrade Roadmap
⭐ PHASE 1 — Foundation Enhancements (Low effort, high impact)
These upgrades make Codexia more accurate without changing your API.
1. Deterministic File Role Classifier (DONE)
Effort: Already implemented
Impact: High
Why: Gives the model a head start and stabilizes architecture analysis.
2. Deterministic Coupling Score
Effort: Low
Impact: Medium
Why: Replaces model guesswork with a formula based on imports + cross‑file references.
Plugs into:
projectContext.js → add imports extraction
analyzeProject.js → compute coupling before sending to model

⭐⭐ PHASE 2 — Structural Intelligence (Medium effort, very high impact)
These upgrades make Codexia feel like a real architect.
3. Dependency Graph Extractor
Effort: Medium
Impact: Very high
Why: Enables:
- migration sequencing
- coupling analysis
- risk propagation
- UI → ViewModel → Service mapping
Plugs into:
projectContext.js → extract imports
analyzeProject.js → include graph in context
System prompt → model uses it for reasoning

4. ViewModel → UI Mapping
Effort: Medium
Impact: High
Why: Lets Codexia say:
- “HomeScreen uses HomeViewModel”
- “This ViewModel is unused”
- “This ViewModel is shared across screens”
Plugs into:
projectContext.js → detect ViewModel usage
projectContext.js → detect composables referencing state
Analyzer → model uses this to infer architecture

5. Service Usage Mapping
Effort: Medium
Impact: Medium
Why: Helps Codexia understand:
- API dependencies
- repository patterns
- network layers
Plugs into:
projectContext.js → detect service calls
Analyzer → model uses this for migration difficulty

⭐⭐⭐ PHASE 3 — Migration Intelligence (High impact, optional)
These upgrades turn Codexia into a migration strategist, not just an analyzer.
6. Migration Timeline Estimator
Effort: Medium
Impact: Very high
Why: Gives founders and teams a sense of effort:
- “UI migration: 3–5 hours”
- “ViewModel migration: 1–2 hours”
- “Service migration: 2–4 hours”
Plugs into:
Analyzer → new field: migrationTimeline

7. Risk Scoring Formula
Effort: Medium
Impact: High
Why: Makes riskHeatmap deterministic:
- UI files = high
- Navigation = medium
- Data models = low
Plugs into:
projectContext.js → role-based scoring
Analyzer → new field: riskScore

8. Migration Sequencing Engine
Effort: Medium
Impact: Very high
Why: Lets Codexia say:
- “Migrate services first”
- “Then ViewModels”
- “Then UI files”
- “Navigation last”
Plugs into:
Analyzer → recommendedMigrationOrder

⭐⭐⭐⭐ PHASE 4 — Visualization & Frontend Intelligence (Optional but magical)
9. Dependency Graph Visualization Format
Effort: Low
Impact: Very high
Why: Enables a graph UI:
- nodes = files
- edges = dependencies
- colors = roles
- thickness = coupling
Plugs into:
Analyzer → new field: graphNodes, graphEdges

10. Complexity Heatmap
Effort: Low
Impact: Medium
Why: Lets you color files by complexity:
- green = simple
- yellow = moderate
- red = complex
Plugs into:
Analyzer → new field: complexityHeatmap

🧩 PHASE 5 — Advanced Reasoning (Optional, future)
11. Architectural Pattern Detection
Detect:
- MVVM
- MVI
- Clean Architecture
- Repository pattern
- Use cases
12. Anti‑pattern Detection
Detect:
- God classes
- Over‑coupled ViewModels
- UI‑heavy Activities
- Missing DI boundaries
13. Migration Simulation
Codexia predicts:
- what breaks
- what needs refactoring
- what order to fix things

🎯 Recommended Order (Founder‑grade summary)
Here’s the roadmap in one clean list:
- File role classifier (done)
- Coupling score
- Dependency graph extraction
- ViewModel → UI mapping
- Service usage mapping
- Migration timeline estimator
- Risk scoring formula
- Migration sequencing engine
- Dependency graph visualization format
- Complexity heatmap
- Architectural pattern detection
- Anti‑pattern detection
- Migration simulation engine
This is a 12–18 week roadmap if done sequentially, or 6–8 weeks if parallelized.

If you want, I can now generate:
✔ A printable PDF‑style roadmap
✔ A GitHub Project board layout
✔ A milestone breakdown
✔ A “Phase 2” implementation plan
✔ A “Phase 3” architecture diagram
Just tell me what format you want.
